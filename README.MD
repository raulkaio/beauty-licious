# There's no README, it's all a joke! ðŸ’„ðŸ’…

If you're here, it's probably because you've heard about our incredible cosmetics site, created by our cutting-edge technology company, **Serafim Corp.**!
But it's all just a joke, we wanted to bring a meme to life.

It all started with a meme of a client asking a web developer to add a mirror to their cosmetics company's website. We laughed a lot and thought "let's do it? it will be fun".

And here we are, the rest is history.

This site is just for having some fun with the limits of HTML and web languages.
You can use the project, test it, redo it, we hope you like it!
